# Urbit Visor Notes

This repo contains two applications: a webapp to take notes using Urbit Visor and graph-store, and a browser extension to write quick notes while browsing other pages, using the same backend as the webapp.

## Getting Started

These apps were made as learning material for the Urbit Visor Developer guides at https://(TBD).

To use Urbit Notes, visit https://(TBD) or compile the apps yourself. Please see the instructions inside each folder.
