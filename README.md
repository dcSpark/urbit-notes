# More Information

This repo contains two applications: 
1. An Urbit Web App to take notes using Urbit Visor and graph-store
2. A UV (chrome browser) extension to write quick notes while browsing other pages. 

Both use the same backend, thereby unifying the data but providing end users two different experiences for how to interact with the backend.

# Developer Guides

Lengthy guides explaining how to build the web app and UV extension variants of Urbit Notes will be available for developers to learn from scratch. The target audience is JS/TS developers with limited Urbit experience, thus acting as a great on-boarding mechanism.
